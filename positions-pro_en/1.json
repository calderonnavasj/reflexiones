      "description":"Welcome to the next segment of Youth Meditations. This time we’ll talk a bit about evil desires of youth. According to a Biblical Dictionary, the word “passion” comes from the Greek term “pathos” which means an extreme desire, used to describe both good and bad wishes. So we could say that youthful passions are those excessive desires that are in a young person.\nThe Bible warns us about running away from evil desires of youth. These are all those actions and attractions that motivate us to sin or offend the character of God. Running away is more than turning away, it requires effort and quickness to face the danger to which one is exposed. Running away is for young people who love God.",
