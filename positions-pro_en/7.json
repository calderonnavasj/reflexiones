      "description":"In the Christian film 'God’s not Dead 1', there is an episode in which the son of the lady suffering from dementia visits her, and expresses to her: you always did good, you have been Christian since your childhood, instead I have been bad and sinful; you are struggling with your issue, and I have a perfect life, explain that to me. She answers: Sometimes the enemy keep you away from problems, because he doesn’t want them you believe in God, your sin is like a prison, except it’s nice and you don’t feel the need to get out of there, the door is open until time is up, and when it closes it’s too late. \n\nWhen we are young people it is normal to look at bad people succeed (having cars, houses, money, pleasures, etc.) and Christians experiencing crises and difficult situations, then we wonder what happens, and we even get to think the bad guys are doing better (such as drug-dealers, killers), and we may have the wrong idea of being like them. But we must be careful. Those roads have endings of death, prison, family disgrace, etc. On top of it…God’s judgement. ",
