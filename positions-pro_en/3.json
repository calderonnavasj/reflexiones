      "description":"Some of the evil desires of youth that causes disastrous effects in Christians are: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions 21 and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. All of these led by the wildness and sexual immoral acts. Which hurt God’s heart. \nThe verse emphasizes in three main ideas: First, marriage as a form to enjoy couple life. Second, sexual faithfulness in the couple committed to marriage. Third, God’s disapproval to those who distorted this beautiful act of union, pleasure, calling, and worship.\nLadies, do not lose your identity, don't give yourself up to sin just for a moment of pleasure. A Christian writer says: “Unless two people are ready for marriage, it would be a silliness for them to have sex since they don't have what sexual relation symbolizes” (Foster, 1998, pg. 60).",
