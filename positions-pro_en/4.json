      "description":"We can define “a trend” as: a mode or custom that is in vogue for some time, or in a particular country. Social use for a short period of a form of dress, an ideological or artistic tendency. This means that, trends does not only refer to the way you dress, although some only focus on that, but it includes other sectors such as technology, cars, hairstyles, accessories, shoes and others. \n\nI don’t intend to criticize trends. The other way around, I try to deal with the social pressure of trends.  These Bible verses exhort us to receive new stuff with no extreme desire of having it. Besides, it gives us an outlook about trends. There’s anything new, in fact, we just didn’t know it existed.",
