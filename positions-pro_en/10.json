      "description":"In the previous reflections have presented the most common youthful passions in our lives as young people. Now, I’d like us to focus on some recommendations that can help us overcome whatever youthful passions there may be.\n\nIn the bible verse, we find clearly what this first recommendation consists of. He is aware that he is a sinner and has offended God. But in the last part of the text we find the addition to this recommendation: there is nothing that can justify its attitude or its mistake. He is aware of sin. \n\nOne of the biggest challenges is to discover and recognize our weaknesses. The first thing we do is get on the defensive and not give rise to any kind of help. It’s usually known as denial. Here MacArthur and Mack say: 'A denial of clarity is a pretext for refusing to be limited by Scripture and a determination by someone to follow their own inclinations'. (MacArthur & Mack, 1996, pg. 107).",
