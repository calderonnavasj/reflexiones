      "description":"At a brunch organized by Sir Mark Young, Governor of Hong Kong, one of the most distinguished ladies was vexed to discover that she was sitting at the end of the table rather than near the host. At the end of the meal, he approached Sir Mark and told him dryly: -Apparently, you don’t care where your guests sit. -Madam, replied the governor-, the really important people are not interested in where they sit; and sometimes those who are interested in the site are not important.\n\nJust as Mrs. Young there are many people bragging about being important, a great evil of humanity who think she should be treated better than others because she has a title, a good name, money, positions, ministries, etc. But it is necessary to remember that we are all equal regardless of what we have or are, we owe everything to the Lord and far from being proud we must be humble.",
