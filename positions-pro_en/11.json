      "description":"The great evangelical missionary E. Stanley Jones wrote the following words in relation to the importance of confession: I know that there are certain mental, emotional, moral and spiritual attitudes that are unhealthy: anger, resentment, fear, anxiety, feelings of guilt, sexual impurity, jealousy, inferiority, etc. These are the messengers of ill health. So I have learned to surrender these things to Christ when they appear. (Martínez, 2001, pg. 198).\n\nThe biblical text teaches about the importance of confession of sins. The importance lies in the forgiveness and cleanliness that God gives us when we are honets with ourselves and with Him. No matter what youthful passion you have fallen into, God is willing to forgive you and cleanse you of all evil.\n\nConfession also involves sharing with some responsible believer so that he can guide you in this practice. Not to impose a religious discipline on you, but guide you in the process of spiritual reintegration. When we confess our sins before God, we experience deep spiritual, emotional and mental peace. ",
