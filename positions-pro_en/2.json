      "description":"The young lady who watches porn. I had grown up in a conservative and devoted Christian home, attended a Christian church, was an outstanding student, perfect daughter, active member in the youth ministry… and had an addiction to pornography. I looked over for help, but couldn’t find anything for women. Everything was focus on men. I thought I was the only girl struggling with this issue. Whatever you’ve done in the past, or whatever you’re doing in the present, it is not beyond the reach of God’s grace and love. It is not beyond the cross. You’ve not sinned beyond the cross. God’s love for you is real.",
