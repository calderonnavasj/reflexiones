      "description":"We were traveling with a friend and his wife in their car, but on the way while he was driving, he took one eye to the front and another on his phone, chatting with someone else. His wife told him several times to concentrate on the road, to which he responds: "Yes, my love." But he continues on the phone and driving, then a car stops and he was about to another car; this time the wife yells at him: Who controls this? You control the phone or the phone controls you? \n\nThis story is repeated in many cases, not mattering if they are young people or adults, to whom the same question must be asked. Because some people say that the problem is social media or phones, trying to avoid the responsibility of each person. Human beings get easily attracted by an object, causing great and irreversible damages.\n\nBut it is time to make this verse a reality in our lives, the Lord has enabled us with power, love and self-control, which indicates that we can not only control an object, but also ourselves. Let’s be responsible with social media.  ",
