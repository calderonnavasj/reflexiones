      "description":"When Ulysses was sailing near the island of the sirens, in order to prevent his men from being seduced and attracted to its beaches, he filled his ears with wax and tied himself to the mast. But when Orpheus passed near the island, in search of the golden fleece, being as great a musician as he was, he composed better music than the sirens and therefore was not attracted to the island.” (Martínez, 2001, pg. 65).\n\nThe world, through music, is seducing, attracting, tempting and corrupting much of humanity, especially children, teens and youth. The Word of God, recommends us to make use of music but oriented to edification and communion with God. That is, to listen to what contributes to our approach and dependence on God. \n\nIt is necessary to make right choices with the music we hear, this because the music is highly persuasive and through the lyrics and musical genres, convinces us to believe and even to do something. Consider this: the music of the Lord is much better, His promises are superior, and its promises cannot be compared to what the world has to offer.",
