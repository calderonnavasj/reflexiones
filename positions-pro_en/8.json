      "description":"Naboth had a vineyard, Ahab who had lots of land and vineyards, when he saw the vineyard of Naboth he liked it, to the extent that he wanted to buy it, he did everything possible to acquire it, but unable to obtain it he became sad and ill. That caused Jezebel the wife of Ahab to kill Naboth so that Ahab could have the vineyard. \n\nThe story of Ahab and Naboth is a clear example of greed, how it works and the effects it has on the lives of people who suffer from it and those around it. The root of greed is not being satisfied with the things we have and we begin to want the things of others, as the saying goes: 'the neighbor’s grass looks greener.'\n\nBe careful, you may admire what others have but wanting to take away or possess what God has given them becomes greed, this is sin and brings consequences in your life.",
